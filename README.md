# The 11 Stylized facts of financial time series

Cont in 2001 came up with 11 statistical properties of price changes across a wide range of instruments, markets and time periods

1. Absence of (linear) autocorrelations:
2. Heavy tails:
3. Gain / loss asymmetry
4. Aggregational gaussianity
5. Intermittency
6. Volatility clustering
7. Conditional heavy tails
8. Slow decay of autocorrelation in absolute returns
9. Leverage effect
10. Volume / volatility correlation
11. Asymmetry in timescales 

In this project we test each of these stylized facts against modern intraday US stocks and options data.
